# VentilationSystem
Decentralised ventilation systems

The project (will) contain the documentation of the hardware components (electronics and all the other stuff) and the software to control the hardware.
The ventilation system is decentralised, so there are no tubes or something else to transport the air through the house. The system consists of a number of ventilation pairs. Each pair consists of two fans and a ceramic heat accumulator. It is a often sold principle. But most commercial systems are very expencive (300 to 1000â‚¬) and the core components are not that tricky. 
Here is a incomplete list of commercial suppliers:

- https://www.inventer.de
- https://www.kermi.de/raumklima/produkte/wohnraumlueftung/dezentrales-system/
- ...

So I thought it should be possible to build such a system by my own.
